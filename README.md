# Visual AI  
**Training Artificial Intelligence Models Through a Visual Interface**

Visual AI is a web-based system that enables users to train artificial intelligence models
through an intuitive **visual interface**, without relying on pre-built machine learning libraries.

The project focuses not only on *using* machine learning algorithms, but on **understanding how they work internally**.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The main objectives of Visual AI are:

- To implement machine learning algorithms **from scratch**
- To make the model training process **transparent and visual**
- To allow users to:
  - Upload datasets
  - Identify the problem type
  - Manually configure model parameters
  - Observe the training process step by step

Visual AI is designed as both an **educational tool** and an **experimental model development platform**.

---

## 🧠 Supported Problem Types

- **Regression**
- **Classification**
- **Time Series Analysis**

The problem type is automatically determined as soon as the target feature is selected.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- 📁 CSV dataset upload
- 🔍 Automatic data analysis (feature types, target detection)
- 🧮 Machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch
- 🧠 Manually adjustable model parameters
- 📉 Train / validation / test split
- 📊 Loss and metric visualization during training
- 🗂️ Downloadable training logs
- 💾 Saving trained models and parameters to a database
- 🌐 User-friendly, web-based interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Backend
- Express Node.js
- Python
- NumPy (core model and optimization implementations)
- Django (API and business logic)
- Custom implementations of:
  - Loss functions
  - Optimizers
  - Training loops

### Frontend
- React
- Modern CSS (without UI frameworks)
- Interactive charts and visual components

### Database
- MongoDB (model storage, parameters, and training logs)

## 🧩 System Architecture

The project follows a classical machine learning pipeline:

1. Data upload
2. Data preprocessing and analysis
3. Problem type detection
4. Model construction
5. Training
6. Evaluation
7. Model saving and reuse

All stages are presented to the user in a **clear and transparent visual workflow**.

## 📌 Why Visual AI?

- Avoids the “black-box” nature of high-level ML libraries
- Emphasizes mathematical and algorithmic foundations
- Suitable for education, research, and experimentation
- Aims to **teach machine learning**, not just apply it

---

## 📚 Academic Context

This project was developed as part of a Bachelor’s thesis:

**Thesis Title:**  
*Training Artificial Intelligence Models Through a Visual Interface*

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Integration of deep learning architectures
- GPU-accelerated training
- Model comparison dashboards
- Explainable AI (XAI) visualizations
- User-based project management
